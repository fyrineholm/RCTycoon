      <p>GameSpot's Alan Dunkin called it "another fun management simulation from the mind of Chris Sawyer." His praises included the custom naming of everything in the park and position-accurate, real-life sound effects. However, he disliked the limited speed of the game, reasoning that "when you're trying to manage your newest amusement park, time is ticking by, perhaps faster than you'd like." He also criticized the limited amount of scenarios and the player not being able to make their own.[16] IGN's Jason Bates also called it a fun game. He wrote that making custom rides could take a very long time and be very frustrating at first, and players would have to pay too much cash to tasks such as changing land levels, re-positioning trees and build walkways, while they design their rollercoaster. However, once players mastered doing so, "You'll get a lot of pride out of designing some crazy, twisting corkscrew that winds in and out of lakes and hot dog stands, painting it bright neon pink and orange, and giving it a name like the Vominator. And then when the kids start lining up for those $5 tickets, you'll be ready to start saving up for your next ridiculous extravaganza.</p>

      <p>[18] Game Revolution's Ben Silverman highlighted the game's graphical style: "The nature of the game just doesn't call for fancy graphics, and thankfully things run smoothly. The detail level is very cool, from the green-faced nauseous guest to the marquee scrolling the name of the ride at the entrance." He also praised the endless amount of possibilities in designing rollercoaster rides, as well as the huge amount of specific detail, such as the location of a food stall, the player should and can focus on of their park, with the only slight criticisms being the "sloppy" interface.[15], Gary Eng Walk of Entertainment Weekly, who graded the game an A, called it "Quite literally, the thrill ride of the summer",[20] and in 2003, the magazine ranked RollerCoaster Tycoon number 68 on their list of the "100 greatest videogames".[21] Aaron Curtis of Los Angeles Times praised the game, saying that it is "simple enough to enjoy right out of the box but sophisticated enough to keep even the most obsessive park planner happy for weeks."[22]</p>

    <<p> RollerCoaster Tycoon won Computer Games Strategy Plus's 1999 Strategy Game of the Year award, and the editors hailed it as "a superb game that's virtually guaranteed to put a smile on the face of even the most jaded gamer."[23] PC Gamer US and CNET Gamecenter nominated the game for their "Best Real-Time Strategy Game" awards, but these went to Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings and Homeworld, respectively.[24][25] The former publication's editors wrote that RollerCoaster Tycoon "revived the theme park subgenre with its rock-solid design and addicting play."[25] RollerCoaster Tycoon was also nominated for "Computer Game of the Year" and "Computer Strategy Game of the Year" during the AIAS' 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards; both awards ultimately went to Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings.[26] During the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the expansion Loopy Landscapes was nominated for the "PC Simulation", "PC Game of the Year", and "Game of the Year" awards; the first award went to MechWarrior 4: Vengeance,[27] while the latter two went to Diablo II.[28]</p>
