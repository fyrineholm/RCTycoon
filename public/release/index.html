			<div><h1>RollerCoaster Tycoon's initial release by Logan Howie</h1></div>
			<div class="h4">
				<a>The game was first released in North America on March 22, 1999.<br></a>
				<a class="h2"><br>Expansion packs</a>
				<a><br>Two expansion packs were released for Roller Coaster Tycoon that each include new rides, facilities, and scenarios. The first pack, Added Attractions, known in North America as Corkscrew Follies, was released in November 1999. The second pack, Loopy Landscapes, was released in September 2000. The pack does not require Added Attractions to be played, as the disc already includes all the content from the expansion.</a>
				<a class="h2"><br><br>Reissues and re-releases</a>
				<a><br>In September 2001, Infogrames Europe released a compilation called Totally RollerCoaster, which included the base game and the Loopy Landscapes pack on separate discs.[8]

					In 2002, a compilation of the base game and both expansions in a single box, RollerCoaster Tycoon Gold was released by Infogrames in North America. It was re-released in 2003 as RollerCoaster Tycoon Deluxe, which included all the contents of Gold on a single disc. </a>
				<a class="h2"><br><br>Xbox port</a>
				<a><br>A version for the Xbox was also released in 2003, which was handled by Frontier Developments and was published by Infogrames Interactive. The port was mainly the same as the original PC version and included both expansion packs, with controls adapted for a controller. </a>
