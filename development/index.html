					Scottish game designer Chris Sawyer released Transport
					Tycoon in 1994, and spent time to consider what to do for a

					sequel. Some of the revenue he earned from Transport Tycoon
					he used towards travelling in Europe and the United States,
					which included visits to theme parks with roller coasters.
					Though Sawyer said he had hated roller coasters before, he
					became fond of them through these trips, and since has

					/>
					become a roller coaster enthusiast and had ridden on at
					least 700 coasters. From these trips, Sawyer decided to
					follow Transport Tycoon with a roller coaster-based
					simulation, giving him a partial excuse to continue visiting
					theme parks to "research" roller coaster rides. The game was
					to be called White Knuckle for the majority of the game's
					development. However, to follow the tradition of the Tycoon
					titles, the game was renamed accordingly. The game was
					developed in a small village near Dunblane over the course
					of two years. Sawyer wrote 99% of the code for RollerCoaster
					Tycoon in x86 assembly language for the Microsoft Macro
					Assembler, with the remaining one percent written in C. The
					graphics were designed by artist Simon Foster using several
					3D modeling, rendering, and paint programs. Initially,
					Sawyer used family and friends to help playtest the game,
					and then turned to Hasbro, the publisher, to help complete
					more extensive bug-testing and feedback. For his efforts,
					Sawyer made around $30 million in royalties. The Xbox port
					was handled by Frontier Developments, who would later go on
					to develop RollerCoaster Tycoon 3.
