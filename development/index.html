				<h2>Development</h2>

					Dual-tracked roller coasters There are 21 scenarios included
					with RollerCoaster Tycoon, as well as 30 more in the
					Corkscrew Follies expansion pack, and another 30 in the
					Loopy Landscapes expansion pack, totaling 81 scenarios if
					the whole set is installed. Successfully completing a
					scenario will unlock the next one. Additionally, Mega Park
					is unlocked when all 21 scenarios are completed. This
					scenario has no objective (except "Have Fun!"), but allows
					the player to build on nearly the entire map, and eventually
					has all attractions available to build. This is the closest
					to a "sandbox" park, except the player does not have an
					unlimited amount of money to work with, only a $50,000 loan.
					Some scenarios are based on real parks. For example,
					'Katie's Dreamland' (Katie's World in the US Version) is
					based on Lightwater Valley, complete with that park's
					signature The Ultimate roller coaster (The Storm). There
					were two official scenarios that were available for download
					on Hasbro's website: Fort Anachronism and Alton Towers.
					Alton Towers was included with the Loopy Landscapes
					expansion with Heide Park and Blackpool Pleasure Beach and
					was updated to take advantage of the new game components.
					Both scenarios are also included as part of RollerCoaster
					Tycoon Deluxe. The UK edition of RollerCoaster Tycoon Deluxe
					contained Blackpool Pleasure Beach in place of Fort
					Anachronism. Development Scottish game designer Chris Sawyer
					released Transport Tycoon in 1994, and spent time to
					consider what to do for a sequel. Some of the revenue he
					earned from Transport Tycoon he used towards travelling in
					Europe and the United States, which included visits to theme
					parks with roller coasters. Though Sawyer said he had hated
					roller coasters before, he became fond of them through these
					trips, and since has become a roller coaster enthusiast and
					had ridden on at least 700 coasters. From these trips,
					Sawyer decided to follow Transport Tycoon with a roller
					coaster-based simulation, giving him a partial excuse to
					continue visiting theme parks to "research" roller coaster
					rides. The game was to be called White Knuckle for the
					majority of the game's development. However, to follow the
					tradition of the Tycoon titles, the game was renamed
					accordingly. The game was developed in a small village near
					Dunblane over the course of two years. Sawyer wrote 99% of
					the code for RollerCoaster Tycoon in x86 assembly language
					for the Microsoft Macro Assembler, with the remaining one
					percent written in C. The graphics were designed by artist
					Simon Foster using several 3D modeling, rendering, and paint
					programs. Initially, Sawyer used family and friends to help
					playtest the game, and then turned to Hasbro, the publisher,
					to help complete more extensive bug-testing and feedback.
					For his efforts, Sawyer made around $30 million in
					royalties. The Xbox port was handled by Frontier
					Developments, who would later go on to develop RollerCoaster
					Tycoon 3.
