		</header>
		<p style = "text-align: center;">RollerCoaster Tycoon was met with critical acclaim upon its release in 1999, becoming one of the best-selling PC games of its time. Reviewers praised its deep gameplay and the immense creative freedom it gave players to design and manage their own amusement parks. IGN called it "an extremely addictive game" and praised how it appealed to both hardcore and casual gamers. GameSpot noted that while the graphics were relatively simple, the strategic depth and charm more than made up for it, stating, "It has that elusive just-one-more-turn quality that defines all the great games." The game's success was reflected in its sales—it topped charts in the U.S., UK, and Germany, eventually selling over 4 million copies. Its engaging gameplay and intuitive design cemented it as a fan favorite and a cornerstone of the tycoon genre.</p>
